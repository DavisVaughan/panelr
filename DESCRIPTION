Description: This package implements several methods for creating regression
  models that take advantage of the unique aspects of 
  panel data. It automates the "within-between" (also known as
  "between-within" and "hybrid") specification that combines the
  desirable aspects of both fixed effects and random effects econometric models
  and fits them in the lme4 package. Bayesian estimation of these models is 
  supported via the brms package.
