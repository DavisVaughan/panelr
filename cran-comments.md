* This is a new release. Among other useful feedback, on my initial submission
Matthias Sterer asked that I clarify the acronym GEE in the DESCRIPTION. 
I hope that it is noticeable on close reading that GEE refers to generalized 
estimating equations, which I mention by name before then putting GEE in 
parentheses.
